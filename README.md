# SolidEdge-VarHandler

Inspired by a post on Siemens Community I decided to create this control center to easily evaluate variables range values

Actual version is limited and will perhaps be expanded per user requests

Feature list:
- Add any user variables
- Minimum and Maximum range retrieved from the variable table (if available)
- Ability to vary Minimum and Maximum range from the user interface (click on values to prompt)
- Exposed name retrieved from the variable table (if available)
- Ability to vary Exposed name from the variable table (double click on the title to prompt)
- Checkbox to auto retrieve the variable on reload
- Remove button
- Reload button
- Taskbar to easily change values
